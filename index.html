Albert Einstein was born on March 14th 1879 at Ulm, Wurttemberg, Germany. He attended elementary school at the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich, but he was not happy and struggled with the regime. He enjoyed classical music and played the violin.

In 1889 a Polish medical student, Max Talmud, frequently visited the family and became a tutor to Einstein, introducing him to higher mathematics and philosophy. As a result of one of the books he was introduced to, Einstein began to wonder what a light beam would look like if you could run alongside it at the same speed. If light were a wave, then the light beam should appear stationary. Yet, in reality, the light beam is moving. This paradox led him to write his first scientific paper at 16, “The Investigation of the State of Ether in Magnetic Fields.”

In 1894, the family moved to Milan, Italy. Einstein subsequently renounced his German citizenship to avoid military service and enrolled at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich.

Finding it difficult to get employment, Einstein tutored children, until 1902, when the father of his friend, Marcel Grossman, recommended him as a clerk in the Swiss patent office in Bern. Einstein married Maleva Maric in1903. In May, 1904 they had their first son, Hans Albert, and then a second son, Eduard in 1910. He divorced in 1919 and then married Elsa Löwenthal in the same year.

Whilst studying James Maxwell’s description of the nature of light, Einstein discovered that the speed of light was constant, which conflicted with Isaac Newton‘s laws of motion, and it was this realisation that led Einstein to formulate the principle of relativity.

In 1905 he submitted a paper for his doctorate at the Polytechnic Academy in Zurich and in the same year published four papers in the physics journal, Annalen der Physik. These were the Photoelectric Effect, Brownian Motion, Special Relativity, and the Equivalence of Matter and Energy E=mc2.

Einstein subsequently went to the University of Berlin, as director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics from 1913 to 1933.

In November 1915, Einstein completed the General Theory of Relativity, which he considered correct because it accurately predicted the perihelion of Mercury’s orbit around the sun, which fell short in Newton’s theory. This theory also predicted a measurable deflection of light around the sun when a planet orbited nearby, and it was confirmed by observations made by Sir Arthur Eddington during the solar eclipse of 1919. In 1921, Albert Einstein received the Nobel Prize for Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, rather than his work on relativity, which was considered controversial.

In December, 1932 Einstein decided to leave Germany because of the Nazis. He took a position at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, New Jersey, becoming a U.S. citizen in 1940. He also helped with charities working with refugees arriving from Germany.
In the summer of 1939, Einstein became aware of Germany’s success with the fission of the Uranium atom and wrote a letter to President Roosevelt to alert him of the possibility of a Nazi bomb. Roosevelt invited Einstein to meet with him and this led to the Manhattan Project.

He spent the rest of his career trying to develop a unified field theory for the forces of the universe, refuting the accepted interpretation of quantum physics. However, in his later years, he stopped opposing quantum theory and tried to incorporate it, along with light and gravity, into the larger unified field theory he was trying to develop.

On April 17, 1955 he died of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.</p>

<tr><td>Einstein refrigerator
</td>
<td>The Einstein–Szilard or Einstein refrigerator is an absorption refrigerator which has no moving parts, operates at constant pressure, and requires only a heat source to operate. It was jointly invented in 1926 by Albert Einstein and his former student Leó Szilárd, who patented it in the U.S. on November 11, 1930 (U.S. Patent 1,781,541). The three working fluids in this design are water, ammonia and butane. The Einstein refrigerator is a development of the original three-fluid patent by the Swedish inventors Baltzar von Platen and Carl Munters.

<tr><td>The Bose-Einstein Condensate
</td>
<td>In 1924, Einstein was sent a paper from a physicist by the name of Satyendra Nath Bose. This paper discussed detailed a way to think of light as a gas, filled with indistinguishable particles.

Einstein worked with Bose to extend this idea to atoms, which led to a prediction for a new state of matter: the Bose-Einstein Condensate. The first example of this state was produced in 1995.

A Bose-Einstein condensate is essentially a group of atoms that are cooled very close to absolute zero. When they reach that temperature, they hardly move in relation to one another. They begin to clump together and enter into exactly the same energy states. This means that, from a physical point of view, the group of atoms behaves as if they were a single atom.

<tr><td>Quantum Theory of Light
</td>
<td>Einstein proposed his theory of light, stating that all light is composed of tiny packets of energy, called photons. He suggested these photons were particles but also had wave-like properties, a totally new idea at the time.

He also spent some time outlining the emission of electrons from metals as they were hit with large electric pulses, like lightning. He expanded on this concept of the photoelectric effect.

<tr><td>General Theory of Relativity 

</td>
<td>In 1916, Einstein published his General Theory of Relativity. This paper generalizes the concepts of Special Relativity and Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, describing gravity as a property of space and time. This theory has aided our understanding of how the large-scale structure of the universe is set up. 

The Theory of General Relativity can be explained like this:

Newton helped quantify gravity between two objects as a tugging of two bodies, independent of how massive each one is or how far apart they are. 

Einstein determined that the laws of physics hold constant for all non-accelerating observers, that the speed of light is constant no matter how fast the observer travels. He found that space and time were interwoven and that events that occur at one time for one observer could occur at a different time for the next.

This led to his theory that massive objects in space could distort spacetime.

Einstein's predictions have helped modern physicists study and understand black holes and gravitational lensing.

<tr><td>The Photoelectric Effect
</td>
<td>Einstein's theory of the Photoelectric Effect discusses the emissions of electrons from metal when light shines on it, as we alluded to before. Scientists had observed this phenomenon and had been unable to reconcile the finding with Maxwell's wave theory of light. 

His discovery of photons aided the understanding of this phenomenon. He theorized that, as light hits an object, there is an emission of electrons, which he deemed photoelectrons.

This model formed the basis of how solar cells work - light causes atoms to release electrons, which generate a current, and then creating electricity.

<tr><td>Wave-Particle Duality
</td>
<td>Einstein's research into the development of the quantum theory was some of the most impactful he ever accomplished. During his early career, Einstein persisted in asserting that light should be treated as both a wave and a particle. In other words, photons can behave as particles and as waves at the same time. This became known as wave-particle duality.

He is quoted as saying this on the subject, "We are faced with a new kind of difficulty. We have two contradictory pictures of reality; separately neither of them fully explains the phenomena of light, but together they do."

As we think about all of Einstein's "inventions," we have to think of them in the light of his influence. His work advanced modern quantum mechanics, the model of physical time, the understanding of light, solar panels, and even modern chemistry.

Einstein's has unequivocally influenced our understanding of physics as we know it today.
